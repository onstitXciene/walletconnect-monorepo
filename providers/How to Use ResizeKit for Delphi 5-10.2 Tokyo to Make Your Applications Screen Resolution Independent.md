If you are a Delphi developer, you may have encountered the challenge of making your applications adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. You may have spent hours adjusting the layout and fonts of your forms to make them look good on various devices. Or you may have written complex code to handle the resizing of your controls and fonts at runtime. But what if there was a simpler and faster way to make your applications size and screen resolution independent?

Introducing ResizeKit, a form resizing component that makes applications size and screen resolution independent in one easy step. Simply attach the ResizeKit to your form and automatically resize any or all controls and fonts without writing a single line of code. By setting a few simple properties or by hooking into the ExitResize event, you can easily customize the resizing process to work with nearly all types of applications. The ResizeKit can even resize most third party controls.
 
ResizeKit is compatible with Delphi 5-10.2 Tokyo and supports both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. It is easy to use, simply place the control on the form at design time. It can be used immediately from the first day without changing the program design or code in your existing programs. The ResizeKit license is royalty-free for application development and royalty-free for runtime applications.
 
Some of the main features of ResizeKit are:
 
- Automatically resizes all controls and fonts on the form.
- Allows you to specify maximum and minimum form height and width.
- Allows you to specify initial location of the form.
- Allows you to exclude controls and fonts from resizing.
- Resizes most third party controls without the need for additional code.
- Contains easy to use properties and its ExitResize event allows you to customize the resize process.
- Includes useful sample programs that illustrate how to use the control.

If you want to learn more about ResizeKit, you can visit its official website[^1^] or download its trial version[^2^] which is fully functional for 30 days. You can also check out some user reviews[^3^] or read a detailed tutorial[^4^] on how to use ResizeKit in your Delphi projects.
 
With ResizeKit, you can save time and effort in making your Delphi applications size and screen resolution independent. Try it today and see the difference!
  
## How to Use ResizeKit in Your Delphi Projects
 
Using ResizeKit in your Delphi projects is very easy and straightforward. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Download and install ResizeKit from its official website[^1^] or from a trusted source[^2^]. You can choose the edition that matches your Delphi version and platform (32-bit or 64-bit).
2. Copy the necessary files from the downloaded folder into your Delphi development environment and add the ResizeKit component to your component palette. You can find detailed instructions for each Delphi edition in the ResizeKit online help[^3^].
3. Open your Delphi project and place the ResizeKit component on the form that you want to resize. You can also place it on a data module if you want to resize multiple forms.
4. Set the properties of the ResizeKit component according to your preferences. For example, you can specify the maximum and minimum form height and width, the initial location of the form, and the controls and fonts that you want to exclude from resizing.
5. Run your application and test the resizing behavior. You can change the screen resolution or resize the form manually and see how the controls and fonts adjust automatically.
6. If you need to customize the resizing process further, you can use the ExitResize event of the ResizeKit component. This event is triggered after all controls and fonts have been resized. You can write code in this event handler to perform additional actions, such as resizing third party controls that are not supported by ResizeKit, adjusting the layout of complex controls, or changing the appearance of your application based on the form size.

That's it! You have successfully made your Delphi application size and screen resolution independent with ResizeKit. You can now distribute your application without worrying about how it will look on different devices.
